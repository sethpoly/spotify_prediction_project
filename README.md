# spotify_prediction_project

Data science project that provides visuals on Spotify popularity trends and is able to predict the popularity of any song on Spotify given its song features.


Quickstart Instructions:
1.	Click on this link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sethpoly/spotify_prediction_project/master which will redirect you to the hosted Notebook on Binder. It may take a few moments to build the server.

2.	As soon as the server is loaded, it will redirect you to a page with a list of project files. Click the very first file titled “Spotify_Predict_the_Hits.ipynb”. The application will execute and you will be able to interact with the modules.

3.	Sometimes the interactable modules are unable to load, to fix this issue: 
   > Click “Kernel” which is located in the toolbar
   > Click “Restart and Run All” from the Kernel dropdown menu
   > Click “Restart and Run All Cells” from the pop-up dialog menu
   > All the cells should execute, and the interactable cells should work now.
